### File watcher
## Description
This program can watch a directory for file changes and performs an action on the
added/modified files.
Files can be included/excluded using standard python regex.

## Usage
You can configure all the options from `config.yml`.
NOTE: Command line arguments will override values from `config.yml`.

Command line usage can be seen by running the program with `-h` or `--help` as
argument.
